**The lens of Ruscha’s incessant and indiscriminate camera did not focus exclusively on the built environment; the photographs in this collection thus contain voluminous records of the “natural” world as well.**

Simultaneously, they call into question whether it is possible to locate any elements of this landscape outside the scope of a “built” environment. Yet, unlike the evolution of structures sometimes documented in building permits, or the social histories of building ownership and occupancy logged in Census records and city directories, trees and hedges, lawns and flowerbeds left little written trace. But photographs capture the evolution of planted landscapes along the boulevard as elements of the natural world mature and grow, making the significance of Ruscha’s photographic archive particularly profound. They reveal this as a constructed nature, often planted to accompany new development—but only in certain places and times. Exploring the changing visual transcript of palm trees along Sunset Boulevard illuminates the often-gradual ways in which public and private forces, in conjunction with climate itself, redeveloped the city through its natural landscape. In turn, that natural landscape continuously effected its own streetside transformations.

While palms have populated the missions and estates of Southern California since the nineteenth century, it was only in the twentieth century that the tree became a regional icon. Depression-era labor and anticipation of the Olympic Games of 1932 spurred Los Angeles to plant roughly 40,000 Mexican fan palm trees along its boulevards.[^1] A generation or so later, some of those same trees appear in Ruscha’s images. An occasional view down an intersecting side street captures their scale, rhythm, and street-fronting locations; more common in Ruscha’s photographs, however, was the full or partial depiction of one or two trees in a single frame.

### Visual Real Estate

Even as much of the built environment held relatively constant over time, the photographs remind observers that the natural landscape constantly lives and grows, revealing a facet of otherwise imperceptible urban change. [5751 Sunset Blvd](/address/5751) is typical. After a Denny’s replaced a Chevron on the site, palm trees shifted from framing and fronting the adjacent restaurant to ultimately towering over the structure. By 2007, they were utility pole-like stalks extending beyond the photographic frame. This is because the Mexican fan palm, a common Sunset Boulevard varietal, grows up to six feet per year, with mature trees reaching over 100 feet in total height.[^2] The palm tree’s limited lateral footprint, however, is both virtue and vice. Relatively narrow, dense root balls project straight down. This makes the trees apt for planting strips and keeps their roots from buckling concrete or breaking pipes.[^3] The narrow trunks also barely impede sideways views from passing vehicles. But palm trees do little to cleanse or cool the air, or to block traffic noise, and their compact plumage provides limited shade—as the color photographs particularly reveal—diminishing their beneficial effects on the urban heat island.[^4] Other downsides of “these filthy, littering abominations,” as one Angeleno put it, include the weight and girth of their fronds when they fall, the trees’ attractiveness to rats, and the stain of their fruit—although these are not attributes that the photographs generally reveal.[^5] As historian Jared Farmer notes, “Palms have been planted here for what they mean, not what they do. Or rather, what they mean _is_ what they do.”[^6] And so, their impact is often more aesthetic than environmental, even as their visual real estate in Ruscha’s photographs diminishes as they age.

### Uneven Geographies

While palm trees have come to symbolize the entire city and region, their presence is geographically uneven, even along this one boulevard. The California Street Tree Planting Act of 1915 provided that special assessments could fund municipal tree planting or removal. Over a decade later, the City of Los Angeles took up this policy.[^7] In 1927, actress Mary Pickford was one of several citizens who advocated to the City Council’s Public Works Committee in favor of widening Sunset Boulevard and planting streetside palm trees between Normandie and Fairfax Avenues, the bulk of the Hollywood neighborhood. Replacing dispersed clumps of pepper trees with more evenly distributed palms would help create what Pickford called “Los Angeles Beautiful.”[^8] While some criticized a disconnect between the business functions of the boulevard and the country ambience of the proposed trees, the eventual plantings would associate the area and its burgeoning film industry with a distinct brand of LA glamor.

```
The trees’ presence or absence in particular neighborhoods in part reflects larger spatial patterns of historical resource disparities.
```

Ruscha’s images track the enduring concentration of palm trees in Hollywood and West Hollywood during the postwar decades.[^9] Their numbers increased over time, from an average of 100 trees per mile in 1966 to 150 trees per mile by 2007. Put differently, one palm tree sprouted every 12-17 yards between Vermont Avenue and the start of the Sunset Strip. By contrast, the adjacent five miles to the east feature a much sparser collection of trees, averaging one tree every 100 yards in 1973, increasing to one tree every 50 yards by 2007. Thus, palm trees grew across the boulevard, but it was in Hollywood and much of West Hollywood and East Hollywood where they most densely took root. The trees’ presence or absence in particular neighborhoods in part reflects larger spatial patterns of historical resource disparities that extend well beyond investments in natural landscapes alone.

### Plantings and Construction

After the mass public planting campaign of the 1930s, subsequent private plantings tended to accompany changes in the built environment, from the construction or alteration of structures to changes in their occupancy or use.[^10] Across the three decades Ruscha photographed this expanse, 1985 displays the greatest increase in palms. New trees sprouted in front of buildings like [6525 Sunset](/address/6525), the Hollywood Athletic Club. No palm trees existed there in 1973, when the property was home to the University of Judaism. By 1985, however, likely to attract commercial tenants, a new owner had restored the façade and planted a lengthy row of trees in front.[^11]

Similarly, as a paint job transformed [4929 Sunset](/address/4929) from a candy and ice cream shop in 1973 to Los Burritos by 1985, the property’s landscape registered its new use. Two younger plantings replaced the one palm tree to the building’s east.

In 1973, Ruscha photographed the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles at [4661 Sunset Blvd](/address/4661). By 1985, new construction was in progress there. 2007 finds the finished Saban Research Institute, with numerous palm trees sprouting beside it. Where mass infusions of new palms appeared, often, as here, a new building had inspired them.[^12] A direct relationship existed between developments in the natural and built environments.

### Non-Palm Trees

Although the portions of Sunset located east of Vermont have their own tree canopies, the palm is not typically a dominant part. Instead, sephora, acacias, and other species abound. This is a vestige of pre-palm vegetation on Sunset Boulevard as well as a function of less direct municipal investment there, varying topography (such as in Echo Park and Angelino Heights), and physical distance from the glamorous image of Hollywood. In general, where development is older and largely unchanged, new, more recent palm tree plantings are also less common. Where non-palm trees grow, they often stand closer to the buildings, or to the structures’ sides and backs, rather than directly abutting the street. At [2201-2215 Sunset](/address/2205), for example, palm trees peek out from behind the buildings—which themselves appear physically consistent across three decades—but the surrounding flora includes varied types, with just one palm tree still visible by 2007.

There are exceptions to this east/west dichotomy, such as the large outcropping of palm trees in front of the modern building complex at [1111-1115 Sunset Blvd](/address/1115), in Echo Park. Designed by architect William Pereira in 1961 and constructed between 1963 (low-rise portion) and 1973 (eight-story high-rise) as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Water District, these buildings were accompanied from the outset by dozens of new Canary Island date palms and Mexican fan palms. In 1986, the property even won a Special Recognition Award from Los Angeles Beautiful, a business and industry group, for its water-conserving garden on the site.[^13] In the structure’s more recent incarnation as The Elysian apartment building and Holy Hill Community Church, palm trees remain. The unusual appearance of so many palm trees in this eastern locale attests to both the building’s more recent construction and the municipal nature of its original use.

Indeed, another of the most palm-populous properties along Sunset Boulevard is [Hollywood High School](/n/NorthOrangeDrive-1642/1966,1973,1985,1995,2007) (located between the intersections with North Orange Drive and North Highland Avenue, closest to 6767 Sunset), another public site.

### The Endurance and Decline of Urban Nature

In their arrival and disappearance, palms demonstrate the fragility and ongoing maintenance that urban nature requires. Most palm trees last only 100 years, but threats like fungus and weevils can fell them even sooner. Consequently, total numbers of palm trees in Los Angeles today are likely down since the last citywide census in 1990 counted roughly 75,000. While Article 6 of the city’s Municipal Code identifies four tree and two shrub species for protection, palm trees are not among them.[^14] Palms are only protected in six specific locations due to their historic significance. One of those locations is along Sunset, at Hollywood High School. Aside from these few spots, the city does not plan to replace palm trees in kind; climate change has prompted public investment in trees that need less water and provide greater shade. Any palm replacement will fall to individual homeowners and developers.[^15] Although Ruscha’s photographs show only diminishing growth rates among Sunset’s palm trees, rather than an absolute decline, any future surveys should register the loss. This visual documentation of otherwise-ephemeral growth shows how the forces of nature itself help redevelop the city. These only become visible when we examine the city at the small scale.

```

Planting trees is a different sort of redevelopment from the construction of Sunset’s buildings. But, as a close examination of the boulevard’s palms reveals, it is no less a history of gradual, additive, and subtractive changes unfolding slowly enough to elude the eye, but not Ruscha’s camera. The photographs also remind us that much of Sunset contains none of the iconic trees at all, evincing variations in development patterns and socioeconomic geographies alike. Where they do appear, their planting, growth, and decline tell a broader story of Sunset hidden in plain sight: its form ever-changing, reshaped inexorably by the persistent, transformative, and constructed nature of landscape.
