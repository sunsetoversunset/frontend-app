**"There was only one Cinerama, and to appreciate its impact, the intoxicating visual and aural pleasures that it provided for midcentury moviegoers, you had to be there."
Foster Hirsch[^1]** 

In 2009, Ed Ruscha told the arts magazine [_frieze_](https://www.frieze.com/article/life-film-ed-ruscha) about his childhood trips to the movies in Oklahoma. “Most of the films I saw at that time were black and white,” he recalled. “I’ve got a vivid memory of what they looked like on a big screen and the silvery feeling that I got from them.” It was this glittery aura, the promise of staggering scope and scale, that underpinned Ruscha’s disinterest in television, explaining, “I’d rather read a book, see something else or go for a drive along the street.”[^2] Television has historically allowed for, even demanded, liveness, but going to the movie theater puts you in the living world; television is live but always-there, film is pre-recorded, but you have to go to participate. 

Mid-century experimental cinema, from Bruce Conner to Maya Deren, is preoccupied with classical cinema–distorting it, fracturing it, exposing its artificiality. To that end, in his essay “Ed Ruscha’s Moving Pictures,” Matthew Reynolds considers _Every Building on the Sunset Strip_ as one of the artist’s most cinematic projects. He opens: “Ed Ruscha uses the language of film when he talks about making art in Los Angeles… because in L.A., everything seems so ‘cinematic.’”[^3] It is not just the film strip shape and scope of the work that accomplishes this, but the project’s “foregrounding of materiality and the conscious rejection of narrative… [that] are, of course, among the defining features of experimental cinema.”[^4]

Ruscha’s city street photography, the Sunset Boulevard corpus in particular, comprises a movie of sorts, one literally produced on film stock. It’s an experimental movie too, the dreams and fantasies that these marquees evoke punctuating what is otherwise a documentary aesthetic. The “dreams” to which I am referring, of course, belong to the particular magic of the Hollywood Dream Factory. After all, we are in Los Angeles.

And the imaginative, escapist experience of movie-going is signaled by the boulevard’s marquees. They live alongside the signs for dry cleaners or watch repair shops, all three promising service and return on investment. Such an analogy, when it comes to the movies, is both comforting (we all need somewhere to run) and obscene (what are we running from?). In a 1972 television documentary, Dick Cavett intones how “Hollywood, the dream factory, at its worst it was spendthrift, crass and vulgar, but at its best it offered a rich, romantic, compelling world of illusion.”[^5] In the marquees frozen on Ruscha’s film, we see both what Hollywood produces in perpetuity and what it offered audiences at any particular moment: what films were being produced, which genres favored, which stars’ names demanded space on the marquee. 

Across location and year, his marquee photos reveal viewers’ aspirations, their fears, and their ideals, many of which the entertainment industry invented in the first place. (What are movie marquees if not dream journals, doodled mostly by studio executives, dreaming about what “regular people” dream about?) 

Building on the work of Jean Baudrillard, Anne Friedberg writes of the “tension between the material reality of built space and the dematerialized imaginary that the cinema has always provided.”[^6] Perhaps that is what is so disorienting and compelling about these marquees–that abiding, “meta” tension. The marquee is a “material reality,” a plastic or ceramic placard with letters that move, but it also signals or stands in for the “dematerialized imaginary [of cinema].” But just as cinema lives in our memories, our collective preoccupations, it is also a fixture of the urban landscape, recording change over time. Ed Ruscha’s repeated photographs of Sunset Boulevard make this particularly clear. Close examinations of a few of the marquees he captured  illustrate the range of options for cinephiles in a city that, when it sleeps, dreams about the movies.

In short, marquees tell us a lot more than what is, or was, playing. They lay out the imaginations of historical audiences alongside the realities of movie-going at the time; they tap into the histories of Los Angeles (a place where you can live) and Hollywood (a factory made of money and dreams).

### The Stuff that Dreams Are Made Of

The movie marquee is a fossil, a frozen moment in time, not unlike the image itself. It dates the image both literally and subconsciously. One of my favorite family photographs shows my mom, aunt, grandparents, and some unnamed cousins standing on the Atlantic City boardwalk underneath a marquee advertising _Psycho_. For a brief moment, the story of Norman Bates lives in the same visual field as my Italian-Catholic family. But these narratives are always living alongside each other, like neighboring buildings on a city block. If they didn’t, if these demented thrillers didn’t resonate with the pleasant stories we tell ourselves about boys and their mothers, Hitchcock wouldn’t have much of a legacy to uphold.
