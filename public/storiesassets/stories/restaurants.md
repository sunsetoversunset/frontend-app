**When Ed Ruscha first photographed [1525 Sunset Boulevard](/address/1525) in 1973, the small storefront—modern with a gridded tile and stacked brick façade—beckoned its neighbors in with a broad sign advertising “Cuban Mexican Puerto Rican Foods.”**

Then known as Toñita’s, the restaurant served an Echo Park population that included all of those diasporic groups. As new residents continued to arrive in the succeeding years, the restaurant’s name, cuisines, and façade changed too, all recorded by Ruscha. By 1995, its hand-lettered sign advertised Kuko’s Restaurante Mexicano, with a recently stuccoed front meeting a population that, while no longer the center of LA’s Mexican community, maintained a foothold on the Westside. By 2007, Kuko’s had become La Fe Restaurante & Pupuseria, its smooth stucco the perfect surface for bright hand-painted letters that promised menudo and mariscos, pupusas and sopa de pata.

The last two items, both staples of Salvadoran cuisine, indicated the diaspora from El Salvador that had made its way to L.A., and to Echo Park, from the 1980s on. This was just one of the many growing immigrant communities that transformed Sunset as Ruscha photographed the street. So did arrivals from Thailand, Armenia, Guatemala, and Colombia, among others, joining existing and new communities of Mexican, Cuban, Chinese, and Japanese descent. Ruscha’s visits coincided with one of the most dynamic periods in U.S. immigration history, a result of foreign wars, U.S. entanglements abroad, and loosened restrictions enabled by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Los Angeles, long defined by its numerous racial, ethnic, and religious communities, became home to many more.[^1]

By looking closely at one building type—restaurants—one can see those long-standing residents and new arrivals both assert and concretize their presence in the built environment of an increasingly cosmopolitan city, as did the restaurateurs at [1525 Sunset Boulevard](/address/1525). One could make a list of restaurants on Sunset using phone books, newspapers, and business directories. But Ruscha’s photographs reveal more than just occupancy. They also show the physical means and material manifestations of that occupancy upon the built environment, through the fonts and language that proprietors painted as ephemeral signage, the siding and decoration with which they remade existing buildings, and their gradual expansion into neighboring spaces. These changes were not just efforts to attract customers already familiar with the cuisine being served or those seeking something new. Over decades, such entrepreneurial efforts were also a form of accretive redevelopment that reshaped the image and form of one of Los Angeles’s most dynamic boulevards.

### A Geography of Cuisines

Like other building types on Sunset, restaurants arrayed along the street in revealing concentrations, offering evidence of their crucial role as a longtime vehicle for immigrant entrepreneurship.[^2] This becomes visible in a close look at a limited but important portion of the restaurants along Sunset, especially those serving food from Central and South America, and also those encompassing Asian cuisines, especially Chinese, Thai, and Japanese. In 1973, about 30 Latin American and Asian restaurants spread across the ten miles from downtown to Beverly Hills, one-third from the latter group. In contrast with the declining trends among both gas stations and banks, restaurants’ numbers increased over time. By 2007, in fact, the number of Asian and Latin American restaurants had more than doubled, to about 70, with a relatively even split between these two broad categories. Over time, most (but certainly not all) Latin American restaurants concentrated east of Vermont—16 in 1973, 24 in 2007—while a majority of Asian restaurants located west of Vermont: 9 in 1973, 26 in 2007.[^3]

These divergences mapped onto enclaves that the restaurants helped define along the way: Latin American restaurants in Echo Park and Silver Lake; Thai and Armenian restaurants in Thai Town and Little Armenia; and a mix among types in Hollywood and West Hollywood. Across these communities, immense geopolitical events often registered as incremental gestures that nonetheless revealed the crucial role that restaurant owners played in transforming the everyday urban landscape. Broadly, their efforts were visible in three major building types that characterized Sunset’s restaurant landscape. Freestanding buildings, locations in strip malls and mini malls, and storefronts along sidewalks, like [1525](/address/1525), registered different forms of grassroots redevelopment, from signage to wholesale reconstruction.

### Storefront by Storefront

As the characteristic long-standing building type on the street’s commercial blocks, storefronts were, at once, already present, relatively affordable, and easy to modify. They made ready locations for existing groups seeking to assert their presence on Sunset, as did the Mexican residents of Echo Park, long part of this multiethnic community.[^4] Restaurants showed Mexican Angelenos securing a hold in the city and growing it with their success, a story recorded in Ruscha’s photos as Barragan’s ([1536](/address/1536) and [1538 Sunset Boulevard](/address/1538)), started in 1961 by a cook at nearby El Nayarit ([1822 Sunset Boulevard](/address/1822)), expanded from a modest storefront in 1973 to encompass several neighbors. The restaurant’s growth registered architecturally: what in 1973 was a brick and wood-paneled façade had, by 1985, transformed adjacent shopfronts into a Spanish Colonial Revival addition with a tile roof and prominent second story. By 1995, the original façade had gained a matching tan paint job and awnings with a stylized logo. Like the owners of El Rodeo down the street ([1721 Sunset Boulevard](/address/1721)), who grew into and remodeled a neighboring storefront, Ramón and Grace Barragan concretized their permanence in built form.[^5]

Storefronts also recorded shorter runs that nonetheless reflected larger stories about the arrival and reception of immigrant groups. Most notably, signage and façade alterations spoke to the cultural context many Chinese and Thai restaurateurs faced, in which they had to navigate both customers unfamiliar with their cuisines and exoticizing, Orientalizing stereotypes that greeted them. From his earliest visits, Ruscha’s photos reveal restaurant owners navigating the latter, often by seeking to turn such stereotypes on their heads. Ah Fong’s Cantonese at [8005 Sunset Boulevard](/address/8005) predated Ruscha’s 1966 photographs and stood immediately east of his first Sunset Strip view. Ruscha’s photographs from 1973 and 1985 show an unchanging façade with stylized lettering—sometimes called the “chop suey” font, also visible at [5050](/address/5050) and [6530 Sunset Boulevard](/address/6530)—and similarly cartoonish architectural decorations. If ethnically reductive, such tropes also evinced owners’ efforts to draw the dollars of Hollywood-area customers who sought a stereotypical idea of “Chineseness” as they dined.[^6] At many Thai restaurants, too, immigrant entrepreneurs, part of a wave of new arrivals from Thailand, sought to make a new cuisine legible to potential customers through signage. By 1985, Chamchun Restaurant’s storefront ([5936 Sunset Boulevard](/address/5936)) bore an awning promising “Thai-Chinese,” a common strategy among its peers as well, which joined one less familiar East Asian cuisine with a very different but more familiar one to appeal to prospective diners.[^7]

### Opportunity in the Strip Mall

Chamchun was one of many Thai restaurants that reshaped both the dining and urban landscapes of LA in the 1970s and 1980s. Historian Mark Padoongpatt counts at least 200 such restaurants by 1987. While older storefronts housed many of these establishments, later-arriving strip malls and mini malls became especially ideal locations for immigrant entrepreneurs who were likewise later arriving.[^8] Thai, Central American, and Armenian immigrants found in such newer structures affordable rents and low overhead. Ruscha’s photographs reveal low-slung strips where both long-lasting and oft-changing restaurants tried their luck, a story typically told through changing signs and few other exterior alterations. At the shopping plaza at [Sunset and Benton Way](/address/2621) in Silver Lake, for instance, which first appears in Ruscha’s 1985 shoot, fleeting signage finds El Cochinito, a Mexican restaurant, and Restaurante Los Arrieros, a Colombian place, replaced a decade later by Tini Thai and Chibcha, also Colombian. By 2007, the strip had received a new awning but Chibcha’s sign remained, sun-faded but testifying to its endurance while others failed.

The architecture and economics of such shopping centers made frequent changes relatively easy, but Ruscha’s panoramas also depict strip mall locations becoming durable beachheads for community formation, as groups inscribed their presence well beyond Sunset. In the overlapping blocks of Thai Town and Little Armenia, retail plazas attained the role of neighborhood institutions. [5233 Sunset Boulevard](/address/5233), with brick shopfronts and a raked metal roof fronted by oval signs, was already home to Jitlada and a neighboring Thai market in 1973. As Ruscha revisited Sunset, Jitlada kept its place. By 1985, it had taken over the market to expand its dining room, and its Thai and English signs would remain the same thereafter, the painted red-and-gray sheet metal above and a green awning the only things to draw the attention of passersby to what became one of the most renowned Thai restaurants in the U.S.[^9] A block east, a newer shopping strip became, by 1995, home to Sahag’s Basturma ([5183 Sunset Boulevard](/address/5183)), its tiny red block letters barely visible in Ruscha’s photographs. Yet it, too, gained iconic prominence, its Armenian sandwiches likewise becoming nationally known.[^10] Such efforts, shop-by-shop, strip-by-strip, helped put communities on the map, a grassroots redevelopment no planner could claim as their own. Thai Town officially gained that name in 1999, even as many Thai Angelenos had moved to the suburbs. Little Armenia attained its moniker the following year.[^11]

### Becoming Part of the Everyday Landscape

On dense Sunset blocks, freestanding restaurants were relatively rare yet told equally important tales of LA’s diverse communities reshaping the city’s built environment. [4929 Sunset Boulevard](/address/4929), a candy and ice cream store in 1973, had become by 1985 Los Burritos, a Mexican restaurant that endures in 2023. Paintbrushes transformed a sweets shop’s metal paneled façade into a billboard for Mexican cuisine. “Mexican Restaurant,” the façade proclaimed in prominent letters that only became bigger by 1995. By then, huge red type filled half of the façade, stating the same message far larger than even the restaurant’s name. Colorful signs flanked the sides, describing what diners could find inside. By the mid-2000s, Mexican cuisine was no longer seen as unusual or limited to certain neighborhoods. At Los Burritos and dozens of other restaurants, all the way through Hollywood, it had become part of the everyday landscape.

A West Hollywood site charts the rise of another cuisine that became part of LA’s daily life. When Ruscha photographed the Sunset Strip in 1966, [8225 Sunset Boulevard](/address/8225), once the home of Preston Sturges’s Players Club, stood as Imperial Gardens Sukiyaki. Transformed by the Japanese-American architect Kazumi Adachi, the restaurant’s elegant Japanese modernist façade matched its menu, both appealing to celebrities and affluent neighbors on Sunset’s western reaches.[^12] Sushi and sashimi were among the restaurant’s offerings starting in 1966, making it the first such LA restaurant outside Little Tokyo and one of the first in the nation.[^13] Ruscha’s repeated visits depicted Imperial Gardens’s persistence to the early 1990s, when it became the famous Roxbury nightclub and finally, by 2007, Miyagi’s, a Japanese-themed club that combined the building’s previous lives. By then, the façade’s minimalism had given way to a caricatured version of traditional Japanese architecture, and the sushi sold inside, once rare, was now commonplace.

Ruscha’s camera found at least seven sushi restaurants in 2007, most concentrated on the Strip. They were part of a street whose Asian and Latin American restaurants had become, in these four decades, less tied to immigrant enclaves and more a quotidian part of dining in Los Angeles. That sushi and burritos, or even pad thai and pupusas, were increasingly ordinary, however, did not indicate their seamless absorption into the streetscape. Rather, the restaurateurs and proprietors who ran such businesses communicated their presence in both modest and more extensive gestures at the building scale. Taken together, they created grassroots redevelopment that added up on Sunset—an index of the growing size and influence of the many diasporic communities, longstanding and recent, who had come to make LA their home.

### Notes

[^1]: LA’s Eastside has had a much larger concentration of Mexican-descended residents, yet Sunset has nonetheless been home to a sizable Mexican-American population over decades. Cuban, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran populations between Hollywood and downtown were notably large compared to other parts of the city by the late twentieth century; Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and other Central American groups concentrated in areas including Hollywood north of Beverly Boulevard. Among East Asian immigrants, the area around Sunset included notable—though not the region’s largest—populations of Chinese and Vietnamese (both near Chinatown), Japanese, and Filipino descent by the 1990s. Thai immigrants represent the boulevard’s most significant population of East Asian descent.
