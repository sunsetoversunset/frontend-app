**Bank branches represented a ubiquitous and, in the era of Ed Ruscha’s transits, essential function as Sunset Boulevard cut its way from West Hollywood to downtown. Yet the picture of banking changed dramatically in this period.**

Where 26 banks stood along these ten miles in 1973, just 14 banks remained by 2007. And within this mix, the number of choices had thinned. By 2007, someone banking on this stretch of Sunset could select from just seven different corporate choices, a dramatic drop from the 17 available three decades earlier.

In this, Sunset’s bank buildings indexed larger trends in U.S. capitalism and corporate organization. The 1980s and 1990s saw a period of national and international financial consolidation that exceeded in number and scale any previous era. With a disruptive banking crisis and statutory changes enabling banks to freely expand across state and regional lines, big banks got even bigger. Others disappeared amid a flurry of mergers and acquisitions. The inequality of banking grew too, with fewer branches gravitating toward more affluent customers.[^1]

```
Despite the turmoil of globalization, capitalism’s roiling waves wrought surprisingly subtle changes on Sunset.
```

The built landscape of banking on Sunset in these decades broadly reflects such changes, but a closer look also suggests a range of more nuanced development stories within this transformative period in the history of capitalism. Banks occupied a variety of building types on Sunset, from modernist jewel boxes to austere towers and adapted storefronts. When they departed, they left behind different physical traces: unused deposit boxes in nondescript facades, customized structures requiring adaptation for other uses, sites readymade for new banking tenants, and, in some cases, nothing at all. Some banks—the consolidators, not the consolidated—endured effectively unchanged for four decades.
Considering urban change along Sunset Boulevard through banks reveals a story of consistency amid underlying churn, persistent presence and telling absence. Despite the turmoil of globalization and the emergence of giant multinational corporations in these decades, many present in Ruscha’s photographs, capitalism’s roiling waves wrought surprisingly subtle changes on Sunset Boulevard.

### Beyond Ruscha’s Viewfinder

What Ruscha’s photos don’t depict tells as important a story as what they do. The images evince a notable disparity in banking access between the stretch west of Vermont Avenue, comprising West Hollywood, Hollywood, and East Hollywood, and the area east of this section, passing through Silver Lake and Echo Park into downtown LA. The former (western) section included 20 banks in 1973, while the latter held just six; in 2007, that division comprised 10 banks against four. Residents across this extent were broadly similar according to Census measures of family income, but the westernmost miles were closer to affluent Beverly Hills and the Hollywood Hills. And Census data encompassing the miles east of Vermont between 1970 and 2000 showed a population less likely to self-identify as white and more likely to be born outside the United States.[^2] Access to banking has long correlated directly with race and income in the U.S, and Ruscha’s panoramas record the local version of this national inequity.[^3]

Where banks were present, the midcentury era saw a dramatic change in their architectural form with the rise of modernist pavilions and skyscraping towers. But these joined a boulevard where banking had long preceded Ruscha’s arrival in the 1960s. By the time he began photographing Sunset, some banks had served customers for decades. [7630 Sunset Boulevard](/address/7630) had been home to Security First National Bank, later Security Pacific, since at least the 1930s. In 1973, the bank still stood in a dignified Renaissance Revival edifice, though it would not last much longer. In 1992, Bank of America acquired Security Pacific, then the largest merger in the history of U.S. banking (combined they represented 6.4% of total U.S. banking assets).[^4] Empty, yet best suited to banking, the building at [7630 Sunset Boulevard](/address/7630) met its end by 1995. Ruscha’s photo from that year shows a postmodern Kinko’s standing on the site, all glass block, gridded windows, and angled walls—the future, not the past.

### Modernist Pavilions

Though shedding the architectural revival styles of their predecessors, the custom-built, single-use bank building type maintained an important role across Sunset in Ruscha’s time. Its exemplars adopted a modern pavilion form—mixing solid concrete and transparent glass—intended to communicate enduring ideals of financial stability and customer utility. As with earlier banks, however, such architectural statements proved more aspirational than realistic amid broader churn. In particular, four structures ([2134](/address/2134), [7014](/address/7014), [7700](/address/7700), and [7919 Sunset Boulevard](/address/7919)) saw tenants constantly in flux, while their symmetrical, austere exteriors changed little. Signs registered tenant changes most prominently. Take [7919 Sunset Boulevard](/address/7919), for example, with an extensive glass façade and modest signage on the front window that first denoted the presence of State Mutual Savings (1973), then Far West Savings and Loan (1985), then American Savings Bank. Washington Mutual purchased American in 1996, ending the building’s run as a bank. Its subdivided interior became home to a restaurant and coffee shop by 2007, its pedestal ideal for outdoor seating. Besides seating and signs, the biggest change was in the two palm trees that were barely taller than a person in 1973. By 2007, they extended far beyond the camera lens.

[8150 Sunset Boulevard](/address/8150), constructed in 1960, offered an especially creative example of the pavilion form, its transparent base supporting a visually massive second level, surmounted by a thin roof resembling folded paper. Designed by Hagman & Meyer for Lytton Savings, it emblematized the modernism that would arrive across Sunset and symbolized the values that midcentury banks espoused: honesty, innovation, and optimism. Such iconic bank buildings remained largely intact despite frequent tenant changes. Here Great Western Savings (1973 and 1985), later Great Western Bank (1995), and eventually Washington Mutual (2007) all followed Lytton Savings, but the sign over the door was the most significant exterior trace of those changes (this is not true of the adjacent Lytton Plaza, however, to the building’s east—once an open space with sculpture adjoined by a museum, it became a parking lot by 1985).[^5] Following WaMu’s collapse in the 2008 financial crisis, the one-time Lytton Savings became home to Chase Bank. Developers soon eyed the site for new mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry. Despite determined preservationists, in 2021 it succumbed to demolition.

### Achieving New Heights

Lytton’s modernity carried through the wave of modernist towers on Sunset—some taller than anything previously built on the street—that emerged as a new building type soon before Ruscha’s arrival. With glass curtain walls, thin supporting columns, and retail bases, they offered prime office space to commercial tenants. Banks, eager for modern locations and new customers, were a natural fit. They occupied spaces less tailor-made than the functionalist pavilions, and their presence proved more fleeting. [1910](/address/1910), [6430](/address/6430), [6565](/address/6565), [8490](/address/8490), [8730](/address/8730), and [9000 Sunset Boulevard](/address/9000) each had a ground-floor bank tenant by the time Ruscha first photographed it and each lost that initial tenant in succeeding years. Only two had branches at all by 2007.

Most of these followed a similar story of physical transformation, with relatively modest changes driven by a competitive real estate market and changing fashions, not corporate directives from the banks themselves. [9000 Sunset Boulevard](/address/9000) was emblematic. Security First/Security Pacific maintained tenancy in the eastern storefront there throughout 1966, 1973, and 1985, departing after Bank of America acquired Security in 1992. The tower remained bankless until Wells Fargo occupied the western storefront in the 2000s. Bank signs in a variety of forms and fonts surfaced over the decades, suspended from the building overhang, bedecking the adjacent planter, and eventually landing on the tower façade itself. By that time, the property owner had added a slim decorative strip with the building’s address, a strategy echoed elsewhere too. At [6565 Sunset Boulevard](/address/6565), for example, a series of modest physical changes accompanied bank tenants that shifted from American Finance System (1973) to Mitsui Manufacturers Bank (1985) to Manufacturers Bank (1995), the company’s new name. The base changed from transparent glass to opaque stone, then met the style of the early 2000s with a return to high-transparency glass. Such façade editing proved a common Sunset strategy in both towers and the few shopping strips where banks appeared, its subtlety belying frequent tenant transition amid merger and acquisition.

### Sunset & Vine

Where the “winners” of the bank consolidation era were present, a different story unfolded. Such banks—robust enough to acquire rivals—exhibited remarkable continuity of both tenant and form, proof in the built environment of their growing corporate strength. This could be seen vividly at Sunset’s intersection with Vine, where multiple banking vernaculars unfolded simultaneously. Around the crossroads stood two skyscrapers, [6255](/address/6255) and [6290 Sunset Boulevard](/address/6290) (the Sunset Vine Tower, LA’s tallest building upon its 1964 completion), with oft-changing bank tenants; two modernist pavilions, [6320](/address/6320) and [6300 Sunset Boulevard](/address/6300), each housing a single bank; and a third single-occupant design, originally built for Home Savings and Loan (1500 Vine Street).[^6] This last, completed in 1968, is perhaps Sunset’s most renowned bank building. Like other Millard Sheets designs for Home Savings, the modern branch included exterior mosaic murals, here depicting movie stars, an homage to the bank’s Hollywood site. The unusually iconic building’s exceptional exterior remained largely untouched as it transitioned from Home Savings to Washington Mutual in the 1990s, then to Chase Bank.

“Winners” of the bank consolidation era exhibited remarkable continuity of tenant and form, proof in the built environment of their growing corporate strength. 
```

The two buildings that anchored this intersection’s southwest corner were less architecturally engaging examples of the modernist pavilion type but nonetheless powerful symbols of the consolidators’ economic might. [6320 Sunset Boulevard](/address/6320) housed Wells Fargo in 1973 while [6300](/address/6300), next door, housed its competitor, Bank of America. Remarkably, amid the many changes along Sunset, these buildings still housed Wells Fargo and Bank of America in 2007. Both banks, while California born, had gained an increasingly ascendent national profile during the intervening decades. The stability of occupancy at each site translated to stability of appearance. Each building gained ATMs by 1985, changing years brought changing signage, and the palm trees in front of [6300](/address/6300) grew from little to very large. But they stood steadfast, anchoring this intersection while the banking industry experienced great turbulence on the street, in the state, and nationally.

### The 40-Year Prize

Only two other banks attained the same endurance prize as [6320](/address/6320) and [6300 Sunset Boulevard](/address/6300), remaining unchanged in both form and occupant during this period. [1572 Sunset Boulevard](/address/1572), a 1920s-era building that had been home to Bank of America since 1930, represented one such case.[^7] The other, [9021 Sunset Boulevard](/address/9021), rose in the 1950s, not long before Ruscha’s 1966 photography of the Sunset Strip. The four are the survivors among the 26 banks that stood on Sunset in 1973, and [9021 Sunset Boulevard](/address/9021) is the only bank to appear in all of Ruscha’s photos. It was a Bank of America when Ruscha published Every Building on the Sunset Strip (1966). It remained a Bank of America into 2021.[^8] A modest, modern building, its two stone walls and two thin columns support a concrete band that spans the façade and continues up sloping Wetherly Drive until meeting the street, allowing cars to park upon the roof. Despite the passage of time, little of this L.A.-friendly form changed over 41 years but an ATM and some shading panels, later removed. Varying signs recorded Bank of America’s changing corporate identity, from simple, clean capital letters to the familiar chunky font and abstracted U.S. flag of the new century.

[9021 Sunset Boulevard](/address/9021) is a survivor of the most torrid period of bank merger and acquisition in U.S. history. Bank of America, like Wells Fargo, was a consolidator in that period, not the subject of consolidation. Without other development pressures on this site, then, the little bank stood untested. At the broader scale, however, banking on Sunset had changed dramatically for consumers, with less than half of the choices they would have had in 1973. Banking on Sunset became more like banking on any major street in any major city, where one could visit Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank, or Chase. Gone were Security Pacific, United California, Los Angeles Federal, Lytton, and a range of others that had made up the landscape of banking when Ruscha first drove down Sunset Boulevard to record its facades.

Even as banks competed on national and global scales, with headquarters increasingly far from LA, many of their visible physical changes derived from local contexts and choices.
```

Viewing Sunset through its banks reveals a built environment whose churn was not nearly as tumultuous as the history of the banking corporations themselves in these transformative decades. The street saw new signage on lasting structures, modest ground-floor renovations, reskinned facades, and, rarely, demolition. Yet even as banks competed and merged on national and global scales, with headquarters increasingly far from LA, many of these visible changes derived from local contexts and choices. They were less the result of sleek, totalizing corporate identities or the work of capitalism’s invisible hand than the sum total of decisions made by property owners modifying buildings to appeal to new tenants, new banks reoccupying spaces old ones had departed, and existing banks updating to meet the moment. Some banks—and many buildings—endured, while others left little behind.

In 2000, the same tract areas were, respectively, 49.71% white, 56.55% foreign born, 31.27% white, 61.68% foreign born, and 37.64% white, 51.59% foreign born. Average family income in the same tracts in 1970 was, respectively, $8988, $8794, and $9545, and, in 2000, $29390, $33702, and $47391.

A Geographic Investigation of Financial Services Availability_ (Lawrence: University of Kansas, Center on Assets, Education, & Inclusion, 2017). Exploitative banking alternatives, like check cashing and payday lending, often seek customers in underbanked areas. While these were present on Sunset too, their location does not closely correspond with the absence of bank branches, though their arrival dates did have some correlation. By 1985, check cashing businesses were present at locations including [1561](/address/1561) and [2825 Sunset Boulevard](/address/2825), and at the intersection of Sunset and Hollywood Boulevard; by 2007, similar businesses had arrived to [5609](/address/5609), [6547](/address/6547), and [7040 Sunset Boulevard](/address/7040) as well.
